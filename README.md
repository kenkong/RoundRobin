# RoundRobin #

CS 4753 Project

RoundRobin is an innovative crowdfunding platform. Instead of offering ventures montary contributions, contributors (providers) may offer entrepreneurs (builders) services and connections. Together, builders and providers can help advance ventures like never before.


# Instructions on Website Setup #

To run our website locally, first download our v1.1 tag. You can begin by running the index.php file in your localhost by typing "localhost/RoundRobing/index.php" into your browser after dropping the file in your "htdocs" and connecting to a localhost.
When you would like to log in and hit the "Login" option on the navbar, be sure to have your server configured. Your server should be pointed to the 'root' and you will need to make sure this is not password protected. We will create the databases for you, so you don't need to worry about that!

# Instructions on Software Downloads #

To run our website locally, you will need to copy the zip folder into a localhost repository. If you do not have a locally deployable management system, there are many options for running a localhost.
We recommend that you use XAMPP. Follow the link below to successfully download XAMPP. Once downloaded, you should go into XAMPP in your Applications folder and run the "Application Manager." Be sure to run the Apache Web Server and MySQL Database.
From there, copy and paste the RoundRobin folder into the XAMPP "htdocs" files. You can then see the website by going to your browser and entering "localhost/RoundRobin/index.php" which brings you to our homepage.
